Finally I did the paperwork through a lawyer, paying large sums of money. ",

After living through all this, my brother and I decided to found SacaCitas in 2021, so that no other person has to spend more time searching for an appointment all day in front of a computer, leaving this work to us. ",
  "Nosotros-paragraph-3" : "Currently our project focuses on simplifying unnecessary management for you when interacting with one of the many administration websites. We understand that not everyone has 4 or 5 hours a day to sit in front of the computer or with their mobile phone reloading the website to see if there are any appointments available. And this doesn't even guarantee that after so many wasted hours you'll get an appointment in the coming weeks. Our idea with this project is that you save this time and dedicate it to something much better, without having to complicate your life to do a procedure that is relatively quick and simple to do.",
